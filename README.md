# VisAESCrypt

A Visual Cryptography + AES based Image Encryption Algorithm

## Digital Image Processing Research Work

1. Encrypts Image using AES256 with SHA256 hash of the key.
2. Converts the key into an Image using ASCII Encoding.
3. Splits the key into 2 shares using (2, n) Visual Cryptographi Scheme proposed by Adi Shamir S et. al
